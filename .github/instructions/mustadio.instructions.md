Mustadio is an application for tracking the current status of a livestream game called "Final Fantasy Tactics Battleground".

It fetches the current status from a public list of files published by the stream maintainer.

The game allows users to bet on the outcome of matches between computer players.

Mustadio provides a view into the current match so that players can make more informed bets.

Mustadio was originally written in regular JavaScript. This project is an attempt to rewrite in TypeScript.
